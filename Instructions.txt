Learning Goal: I'm working on a website development project and need an explanation and answer to help me learn.

Hello,

I have an assignment which is about web design improvement I need you please to improve this website bannerweb.zu.ac.ae to a better way easier and with a better view and options but with the same idea this is a university registration website. https://www.zu.ac.ae/main/en/ this website is the main university website I have added it so you have a better idea about the university and colors. I only need help with improvements from the first link.

Please use any website or platform. Please try to change all this design to a new one which looks perfect and easy to use.

The changes the I would like are:

Changes:

- Change the view and color of the website to the exact color on the official university website

- Change the photos to real photos of the university and students of the university

- Change enter secure area change it to log in

- Change in case of any issues please send an email to bannerhelp@zu.ac.ae to the email only in the bottom of the page

- After clicking on class schedule i need a better view and options

- Change how to register option to existing Zayed university students registration (leave the link as it is) which moves you to the official website

* If you can add any more options which can make the website look better and easier please do

Please make sure the concept be the same just modify the design and the way the options are displayed

If you have an other platform that can do this will be fine but let me know before you start
